# Sensors :metal:

**Hello everyone! This is my second challenge in course form Ucode IT Academy featuring Ajax Systems.** 

## The main idea  ✨

**This challenge is oriented to work with sensors on the “Sensors BoosterPack” (BME280, BMI160, BMM150, OPT3001 Ambient Light Sensor) and TI LaunchPad CC1352R1.**

## Content

1. **In the folder t00 - mini project that connects launchpad with computer by serial communication using UART. You could write a message in the serial terminal, press «Enter» and see it one more time.**
2. **In the folders t01 and t02 the same mini projects that measure temperature, pressure, humidity and write all information in the serial terminal every 10 seconds.**
3. **In the folder t03 mini project that uses an accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope and writes all measurements in the serial terminal every 10 seconds.**
4. **In the folder t04 mini project to measure lux using OPT3001 Ambient Light Sensor.**

## How to run

**To run and flash these mini projects you could use Code Composer Studio. Note that you need to install some SDKs to work with the Launchpad and Sensors BoosterPack.**
