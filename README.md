# Sensors

This is my second challenge at the Ucode iot track. 
This challenge oriented to work with sensors on the “Sensors BoosterPack” (BME280, BMI160, BMM150, OPT3001 Ambient Light Sensor). 

1) In the folder t00 - code to connect with your computer by serial communication using UART. You could write some message, press «Enter» and see it one more time.
2) In the folders t01 and t02 the same mini projects that measure temperature, pressure, humidity and write all information in a console every 10 seconds. 
3) In the folder t03 mini project that uses accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope and write all information in a terminal every 10 seconds. 
4) In the folder t04 we have mini project to measure lux using OPT3001 Ambient Light Sensor.

To run this mini projects you could use Code Composer Studio.
